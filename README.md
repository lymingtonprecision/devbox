Currently just a Vagrant file that covers the base needs of software development at Lymington Precision Engineers.

## TODO

* Populate the Oracle Docker with an empty('ish) IFS database.
* Add some dotfiles based on my current setup.
* Add ohmygems for Ruby gem management?
* More Dockers or Dokku?
